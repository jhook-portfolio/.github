# About Me:
I'm an aspiring backend engineer, with three years proffesional experience working across the Finance and technology sectors. I graduated in 2021 with a 1st Class MChem from a university consistently ranking within the top 10 in the field. Since then I have gained significant exposure to Public, Private and Insurance markets, acquiring skills spanning IaC, CI/CD, Deployments, Backend Engineering, Low-code and Full Stack Development. At present I specialise in AWS and Postgres but find I excel at transfering the core concepts of computing across new technologies and sectors.
